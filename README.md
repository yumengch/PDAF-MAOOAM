# PDAF-MAOOAM

Coupling PDAF with the Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM). This repository is the code and script used for the paper "A python interface to the Fortran-based Parallel Data Assimilation Framework: pyPDAF v1.0.0".

The repository can also be served as an example of an online coupling of (py)PDAF with a numerical model in a fully parallel setup.
